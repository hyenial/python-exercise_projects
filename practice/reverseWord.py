# Exercise 14
# Write a function that asks the user for a string containing multiple words. Print
# back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. 

# method 1: loop through the words and insert each word at the begining of the result list
def reverse_v1(x):
  y = x.split()
  result = []
  for word in y:
    result.insert(0,word)
  return " ".join(result)

# method 2
def reverse_v2(x):
  y = x.split()
  return " ".join(y[::-1])
  
# method 3
def reverse_v3(x):
  y = x.split()
  return " ".join(reversed(y))

# method 4
def reverse_v4(x):
  y = x.split()
  y.reverse()
  return " ".join(y)
